    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first website after a while.</p>

    <h3>How to bold and italacize words in an element text?</h3>
    <p><strong><em>Lorem ipsum</em></strong>, or <strong><em>lipsum</strong></em> as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying 
       out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown 
       typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of 
       Cicero's <em>De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</em> for use in a type specimen book. 
       It usually begins with:</p>
    <p><em>“Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
         tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.”</em></p>
    <p>The purpose of <em>lorem ipsum</em> is to create a natural looking block of text 
        (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. 
        A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless 
        filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, 
        not content.</p>
    <h3>How to create ordered list, unordered lists, and description lists?</h3>
